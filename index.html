      - question: Best time to visit
        answer: Just as with any destination, you’re able to visit AlUla year-round. However, there are clear winners for favorite months to visit. <strong>October/November</strong> and <strong>February/March</strong> see the mildest weather, meaning not too warm in the daytime and not too cold at night.
      - question: Visa & travel requirements
        answer: Since Saudi opened its doors to tourism not long ago, getting into the Kingdom is easy. 60+ countries are eligible for an eVisa through visitsaudi.com, along with additional options for passport holders with stamped EU, UK or US visas. Visa on arrival is also an option, however, if you’re entering Saudi through AlUla (ULH), it’s recommended to get your visa beforehand. As always, double-check the rules and regulations for your specific situation before traveling. 
      - question: How to get around
        answer: Rent a car, plain and simple. While there is infrastructure in the works for an extended bus system, metro, bike lanes, and more, AlUla is still very much reliant on cars. That goes for residents and travelers alike. Things like Careem (like Uber) or Rekab (for some working residents) are still few and far between or less reliable with their pick-up times and punctuality. 
      - question: Cost of living for residents
        answer: As with any city, there’s a range based on preferences and lifestyles. Whether you’re provided accommodation, rent a flat or a whole farm, if you decide to cook for yourself or prefer to eat out, there’s not a set standard for the cost of living here. We’ve got a more detailed breakdown of typical groceries, the best place to buy veggies, how to navigate the local butchers, and more in our local community forum.
      - question: Healthcare & emergency info
        answer: AlUla has multiple government-run clinics, as well as a host of local private clinics. Walk-ins are usually welcome and the cost for a typical check-up is less than 50 SAR (around 13 USD) without any insurance. Visitors are mandated to buy insurance as part of the visa application, and most government employees are given BUPA health insurance. For small ailments, many pharmacies are located throughout the city and all of the pharmacists speak English. For emergencies, 911 connects you to the police, however knowledge of Arabic is useful.
