        heading: International Airport Code
        text: >-
          ULH is the international airport code for AlUla, which is more reliable then spelling (Al-Ula, Al-’Ula, etc). Flights connect to Amman, Doha, Dubai, and other cities, depending on the time of year.

        heading: Stay connected with the right SIM
        text: >-
          E-SIMs will not cut it in AlUla; we recommend getting a physical STC SIM for the strongest internet. Make sure at immigration they write your border number in your passport – you’ll need it to get the SIM.

        heading: Taxis, car rental and getting around
        text: >-
          AlUla does have taxis or private cars for hire, but you’ll have a much more enjoyable time if you rent your own car. Bonus tip is to rent from one of the car hires, like Lumi or Yellow, in Aziziyah.
