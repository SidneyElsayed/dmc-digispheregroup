        heading: International Airport Code
        text: >-
          ULH is the international airport code for AlUla, which is more reliable then spelling (Al-Ula, Al-’Ula, etc). Flights connect to Amman, Doha, Dubai, and other cities, depending on the time of year.

        heading: Stay connected with the right SIM
        text: >-
          E-SIMs will not cut it in AlUla; we recommend getting a physical STC SIM for the strongest internet. Make sure at immigration they write your border number in your passport – you’ll need it to get the SIM.

        heading: Taxis, car rental and getting around
        text: >-
          AlUla does have taxis or private cars for hire, but you’ll have a much more enjoyable time if you rent your own car. Bonus tip is to rent from one of the car hires, like Lumi or Yellow, in Aziziyah.

      - overline: Winter (Nov - Feb)
        text: The most festive time of the year, with the namesake festival 'Winter at Tantora' celebrating the planting season. Mild daytime weather gives way to chilly nights, so make sure to pack warm clothes.
      - overline: Spring (Mar - May)
        text: Citrus trees are in bloom and the weather is warming up. These sunny days are best spent outside. Currently this period is when Ramadan, Eid AlFitr and Eid AlAdha fall. 
      - overline: Summer (Jun - Aug)
        text: While the reast of the GCC is rife with heat and humidity, AlUla's mountains shelter and cool the valley below. Early mornings are perfect for walks in the Oasis and evening temperatures are great for dining outside.
      - overline: Fall (Sept - Oct)
        text: The summer heat breaks just in time for AlUla's biggest music festival – Azimuth – which kicks off the beginning of the busy season.
