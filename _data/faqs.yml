  - question: Visa & travel requirements
    answer_html: >-
      <p>  Since Saudi opened its doors to tourism not long ago, getting into
      the Kingdom is easy. 60+ countries are eligible for an eVisa through <a
      href="https://visa.visitsaudi.com/" title="Saudi eVisa" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">visitsaudi.com</a>, along with additional options for
      passport holders with stamped EU, UK or US visas. Visa on arrival is also
      an option, however, if you’re entering Saudi through AlUla (ULH), it’s
      recommended to get your visa beforehand. As always, double-check the rules
      and regulations for your specific situation before traveling. </p>

  - question: How to get around
    answer_html: >-
      <p>  Rent a car, plain and simple. While there is infrastructure in the
      works for an extended bus system, metro, bike lanes, and more, AlUla is
      still very much reliant on cars. That goes for residents and travelers
      alike. Things like Careem (like Uber) or Rekab (for some working
      residents) are still few and far between or less reliable with their
      pick-up times and punctuality. </p>

  - question: Cost of living for residents
    answer_html: >-
      <p>  As with any city, there’s a range based on preferences and
      lifestyles. Whether you’re provided accommodation, rent a flat or a whole
      farm, if you decide to cook for yourself or prefer to eat out, there’s not
      a set standard for the cost of living here. We’ve got a more detailed
      breakdown of typical groceries, the best place to buy veggies, how to
      navigate the local butchers, and more in our local community forum. </p>

  - question: Healthcare & emergency info
    answer_html: >-
      <p> AlUla has multiple government-run clinics, as well as a host of local
      private clinics. Walk-ins are usually welcome and the cost for a typical
      check-up is less than 50 SAR (around 13 USD) without any insurance.
      Visitors are mandated to buy insurance as part of the visa application,
      and most government employees are given BUPA health insurance. For small
      ailments, many pharmacies are located throughout the city and all of the
      pharmacists speak English. For emergencies, 911 connects you to the
      police, however knowledge of Arabic is useful. </p>
