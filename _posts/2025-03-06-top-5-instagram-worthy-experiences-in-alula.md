list-1-text-block-heading: Hot air balloons

list-2-description-1: Specifically the Tomb of Lihyan son of Kuza, sometimes referred to as the ‘Lonely Tomb’ for its size and distance from the others. For the money shot, make sure you climb up the sand dune just in front of the tomb for an elevated angle.

list-3-description-1: Contrary to popular belief, you can’t just show up and expect to get to Maraya for these glamorous mirror shots. Book a lunch or a day pass to Habitas or Banyan Tree for access to Ashar Valley, where Maraya is located.

list-4-description-1: This pool and desert background look straight out of your favorite influencer’s filter. With a shallow but wide walkway across the pool, it’s like Habitas created a runway made for the perfect poolside photoshoot.

list-5-text-block-heading: Desert Trampolines
list-5-description-1: Also located at Habitas, these desert trampolines are leftover from the first edition of Desert X AlUla. Easily one of the most unique things in AlUla, these bring back the simplicity of childhood mixed with an artistic take on water scarcity as the trampolines are meant to look like puddles in the arid desertscape.
