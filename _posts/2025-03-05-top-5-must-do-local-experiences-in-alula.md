list-1-text-block-heading: Desert Keshta
list-1-description-1: One of the most beloved Saudi traditions is a gathering, or Keshta. Friends and family pack up a 4x4 or two and drive into the desert and set up camp for the evening. Whether for a full-on grilled feast or a simple coffee and tea setup, keshtas usually last long into the night.

list-2-description-1: This big wheel of bread is unmistakably Saudi. Soft and chewy or thin, crisp and filled with cheese, tamees shops are dotted across town as they’re a staple. Hidden in plain sight, only a small window to order from, these shops are usually found next to a ‘breakfast buffet’ serving fuul and falafel.

list-3-text-block-heading: Walk through the Oasis
list-3-description-1: The beating heart of AlUla, the Oasis is made up of a network of trails – what once was the bustling summer markets and summer homes of the locals. As the seasons changed, people would move from the winter homes of Old Town into the cool shade of the Oasis, rebuilding their mudbrick structures every summer.

list-4-description-1: Dune-bashing is a sport ubiquitous with the GCC. However, AlUla takes a much more environmentally-friendly approach with their designated trails. Expert drivers take the wheel – so, no, you can’t drive – even if you ask nicely.
