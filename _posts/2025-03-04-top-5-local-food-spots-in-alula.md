list-1-description-1: Shaped like a castle, this unmistakable restaurant at the main roundabout into town has hands-down the best mandi in town. Order nafar laham for a taste of slow-cooked wild goat or a traditional half a chicken. Different sides of veggie options are available too – but go before 3pm if you want to try the goat.

list-3-description-1: Best falafel and shawarma in town – and we’ve tried them all. Once the falafel is finished for the day, that’s it, so don’t wait for the craving to hit. Get the shawarma in their saj bread, or fettah shawarma if you want a plate with rice.

list-4-description-1: With a large Bengali population in AlUla, you’ve got to try their fare. Spicy meat, freshly prepared chapati and piping hot chai make for a flavorful and filling meal. In town there are two right next to each other, and you can’t go wrong with their one. Make sure to snack on some fried pakora while you’re waiting.

list-5-description-1: Not really a restaurant, these bakeries are hidden in plain sight. Look for a small window to order from, usually found next to a ‘breakfast buffet’ serving fuul and falafel. The easiest one to find is located directly across from Aramex.
